# Blackjack

    Run the program from the TestBlackjack.java file. 
    
First you will be prompted for the number of decks in the shoe, then your name, followed by the number of chips you'll start out with. The ante is fixed at 1/100th your initial chip amount. After inputting all information in the intro screen the program will deal two cards to you and the dealer, then ask you to bet, hit, stay, or guess the count. To bet, type bet (or any word beginning with 'b'). If betting you will be prompted for the value of your bet, followed by whether to hit or stay. Make your choice by entering a word beginning with 'h' or 's'. If not betting, you can hit, stay, or enter 'g' to guess the count. If you are too high or too low the program will tell you so. If you are within .1 of the count, the program will print 'Success!' and tell you the count.
After you have chosen the dealer will make a choice based on the value of their cards, then both the dealer's and your
cards will be shown. This will repeat until you bust, the dealer busts, or the game is a push. You will then be prompted to
play again. If you choose yes new cards will be dealt and the round will loop again, if no your total winning will be shown
and the game will end.
